**BACKGROUND**

The year is 3048. The Human Race has long since left earth and begun their new lives upon the planet LGHH-3433.9.
However after many years away, scientists have picked up strange signals from their original home planet.
A select few of the worlds most elite scientists have been chosen to go back to earth and conduct research there, in the hope
they might find evidence of new lifeforms on the planet.
However, in a planet so hostile they must embark with proper equiptment.
For them, I have designed a helmet HUD with all the necessary components needed for this treacherous task.

**INFORMATION**
I have included in my HUD

1)A Compass (Top of the Screen)

	This will show the coordinates of the direction the user is facing (by moving their mouse to the left and right of the screen)
	
2)A Power Bar (Bottom Left of the Screen)

	The power bar shows the percentage power left in the helmet HUD
	if the power goes below 20% a warning message is displayed
	and if the power hits 0%,the HUD will shut down
	
3)A Microphone(Top Left of the Screen)

	The microphone lets the user record messages which are sent to other users
	Sound waves detect the users voice and display it to the screen
	
4)A Radar(Top Right of the Screen)

	The radar lets the user pick a designated spot on the screen and send it to other users as a spot 
	of importance
	
5)Vision(Center of the Screen)

	The vision lens is useful for showing the user the direct point in front of them and focusing on it
